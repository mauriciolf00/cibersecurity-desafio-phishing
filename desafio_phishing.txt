The Web Attack module is a unique way of utilizing multiple web-based attacks in order to compromise the intended victim.

The [1mJava Applet Attack[0m method will spoof a Java Certificate and deliver a Metasploit-based payload. Uses a customized java applet created by Thomas Werth to deliver the payload.

The [1mMetasploit Browser Exploit[0m method will utilize select Metasploit browser exploits through an iframe and deliver a Metasploit payload.

The [1mCredential Harvester[0m method will utilize web cloning of a web- site that has a username and password field and harvest all the information posted to the website.

The [1mTabNabbing[0m method will wait for a user to move to a different tab, then refresh the page to something different.

The [1mWeb-Jacking Attack[0m method was introduced by white_sheep, emgent. This method utilizes iframe replacements to make the highlighted URL link to appear legitimate however when clicked a window pops up then is replaced with the malicious link. You can edit the link replacement settings in the set_config if it's too slow/fast.

The [1mMulti-Attack[0m method will add a combination of attacks through the web attack menu. For example, you can utilize the Java Applet, Metasploit Browser, Credential Harvester/Tabnabbing all at once to see which is successful.

The [1mHTA Attack[0m method will allow you to clone a site and perform PowerShell injection through HTA files which can be used for Windows-based PowerShell exploitation through the browser.

 The first method will allow SET to import a list of pre-defined web
 applications that it can utilize within the attack.

 The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing
 and allow you to utilize the attack vectors within the completely
 same web application you were attempting to clone.

 The third method allows you to import your own website, note that you
 should only have an index.html when using the import website
 functionality.

--- * IMPORTANT * READ THIS BEFORE ENTERING IN THE IP ADDRESS * IMPORTANT * ---

The way that this works is by cloning a site and looking for form fields to
rewrite. If the POST fields are not usual methods for posting forms this 
could fail. If it does, you can always save the HTML, rewrite the forms to
be standard forms and use the "IMPORT" feature. Additionally, really 
important:

If you are using an EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS, you need to place the EXTERNAL
IP address below, not your NAT address. Additionally, if you don't know
basic networking concepts, and you have a private IP address, you will
need to do port forwarding to your NAT IP address from your external IP
address. A browser doesnâ€™t know how to communicate with a private IP
address, so if you don't specify an external IP address if you are using
this from an external perspective, it will not work. This isn't a SET issue
this is how networking works.
